            <div class="description"> <p>Hi, my name is Kaavya Menon. I am originally from Augusta, Georgia and I am a first year Computer Science major here at Georgia Tech. I am also considering a minor in Women, Science, and Technology. In high school, I volunteered at the Augusta Medical Center and served as president of my temple's Youth Group, and I earned enough service hours to qualify for the Presidential Volunteer Service Award at the Gold Level. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising, and spending time with my dog, Korrie.</p></div>
